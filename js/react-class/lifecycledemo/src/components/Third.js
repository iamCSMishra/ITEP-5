        <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


            Where does it come from?
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
            I’ve throttled my network speed to Slow 3G to artificially delay the duration of each network request so the placeholder is noticeable (otherwise, because of the small size of the chunks in this demo, we’d get an almost instantaneous load time). Notice how each tab navigation requests a new chunk; the request status is pending until that module is fully loaded. Once the status comes back as 200 (success), the module becomes available to our app. At that point, the placeholder UI gets swapped out, and the real component renders. Additionally, observe that the size of the main chunk is now 4.8kB, whereas previously it was 5.3kB. We don’t see significant savings in this case because the tab panels themselves are quite small in size, but this could make quite the difference for larger bundles.

Moreover, subsequent navigation to previously rendered tabs is snappy, with no delay. Because those modules have already been loaded, no additional network requests need to be made—the app just re-renders. Best of all, components that never rendered won’t ever be bundled into the app or loaded at run time. In this case, the module for the third tab was never requested.

Considerations for Dynamic Imports in React
Dynamic imports are a great tool when used judiciously. But like all optimizations, they don’t come for free.

First, as we saw, dynamic imports require your app to make additional network requests at run time to fetch those lazily loaded modules. This is a classic tradeoff: either you bundle everything and create a potentially slower initial load, or you bundle only the essentials and lazily load everything else. The benefit of bundling everything is that users don’t have to see a fallback UI while the component loads in the background. On the other hand, dynamic imports take a more conservative approach, saving bandwidth on the initial load at the cost of making users wait later on. However, it’s worth noting that this usually won’t cause problems, even if a dynamically imported component re-renders several times. This is because the module will have already loaded after the first request, so subsequent renders won’t make redundant requests.

Second, as I noted earlier, dynamic imports in React require that you specify a fallback UI that gets shown until the component is fetched at some later point in time. If your fallback UI and the real UI differ drastically in the amount of space that they occupy on the page, then this may cause layout shifts, pushing the surrounding content aside to make room once the component has loaded. The original demo used a placeholder with roughly the same dimensions as the real content, so no layout shifts occurred. But here’s another version of the same app with a poorly styled placeholder:

Dynamic imports are a great tool when used judiciously. But like all optimizations, they don’t come for free.

First, as we saw, dynamic imports require your app to make additional network requests at run time to fetch those lazily loaded modules. This is a classic tradeoff: either you bundle everything and create a potentially slower initial load, or you bundle only the essentials and lazily load everything else. The benefit of bundling everything is that users don’t have to see a fallback UI while the component loads in the background. On the other hand, dynamic imports take a more conservative approach, saving bandwidth on the initial load at the cost of making users wait later on. However, it’s worth noting that this usually won’t cause problems, even if a dynamically imported component re-renders several times. This is because the module will have already loaded after the first request, so subsequent renders won’t make redundant requests.

Second, as I noted earlier, dynamic imports in React require that you specify a fallback UI that gets shown until the component is fetched at some later point in time. If your fallback UI and the real UI differ drastically in the amount of space that they occupy on the page, then this may cause layout shifts, pushing the surrounding content aside to make room once the component has loaded. The original demo used a placeholder with roughly the same dimensions as the real content, so no layout shifts occurred. But here’s another version of the same app with a poorly styled placeholder:
I’ve throttled my network speed to Slow 3G to artificially delay the duration of each network request so the placeholder is noticeable (otherwise, because of the small size of the chunks in this demo, we’d get an almost instantaneous load time). Notice how each tab navigation requests a new chunk; the request status is pending until that module is fully loaded. Once the status comes back as 200 (success), the module becomes available to our app. At that point, the placeholder UI gets swapped out, and the real component renders. Additionally, observe that the size of the main chunk is now 4.8kB, whereas previously it was 5.3kB. We don’t see significant savings in this case because the tab panels themselves are quite small in size, but this could make quite the difference for larger bundles.

Moreover, subsequent navigation to previously rendered tabs is snappy, with no delay. Because those modules have already been loaded, no additional network requests need to be made—the app just re-renders. Best of all, components that never rendered won’t ever be bundled into the app or loaded at run time. In this case, the module for the third tab was never requested.
